-> We built an interactive course scheduling web application using Ruby on Rails that would serve as an interface among an institution's registrar, instructors/faculty, and students.

-> The objective of this project was to design a graduate course scheduler that can be used to determine valid combinations of courses a student may enroll in the next semester. 

-> Learning includes Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Postgresql, AJAX, Version Control using Github, Agile Development, third party gems like Devise, Omniauth and cancancan, and Project Tracking using Trello.
